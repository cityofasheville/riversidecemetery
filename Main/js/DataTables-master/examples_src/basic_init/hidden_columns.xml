<info>
There are times when you might find it useful to display only a sub-set of the information that was available in the original table. For example you might want to reduce the amount of data shown on screen to make it clearer for the user. This hidden data can still be filtered upon allowing the user access to that data (for example 'tag' information for a row entry), or this can be disabled. In the table below both the platform and engine version columns have been hidden, the former is searchable, the latter is not.
