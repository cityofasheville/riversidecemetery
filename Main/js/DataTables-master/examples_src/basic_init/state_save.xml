<info>
DataTables can use cookies in the end user's web-browser in order to store it's state after each change in drawing. What this means is that if the user were to reload the page, the table should remain exactly as it was (length, filtering, pagination and sorting). This feature is disabled by default, but can be easily enabled using the <init>stateSave</init> initialisation parameter as shown in this example. Note also that the duration of the cookie can be set using the <init>stateDuration</init> initialisation parameter (which is in seconds).
