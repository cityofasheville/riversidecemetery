<info>
	<p>Often you may want to have your table resize dynamically with the page. Typically this is done by assigning <code>width:100%</code> in your CSS, but this presents a problem for Javascript since it can be very hard to get that relative size, rather than the absolute pixels. As such, if you apply the <code>width</code> attribute to the HTML table tag, this will be used as the width for the table (overruling any CSS styles).</p>

	<p>This example shows a table width <code>width="100%"</code> and the container is also flexible width, so as the window is resized, the table will also resize dynamically.</p>
