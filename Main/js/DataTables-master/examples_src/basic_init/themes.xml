<info>
Styling widgets such as DataTables can often take a considerable amount of time to fully integrate it into your site / application, with the demo styles as a base. This holds true for all widgets, and the jQuery UI team have addressed this issue by introducing themes through their excellent <a href="http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/">ThemeRoller</a>. DataTables has full support for ThemeRoller created themes, all you need to do is enable the <init>jQueryUI</init> flag in the initialisation object, and the required mark-up and classes will be added by DataTables.
